# web-calculator
This is a simple web-based calculator application. It allows expressions to
be input by using either a mouse (with the buttons on the calculator), or a
a keyboard. A unique feature of the calculator is the ability to edit the
results of calculations directly without re-entering them. This feature is
useful for evaluating long expressions.
